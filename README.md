# OpenSSL Bazel Rules
## Purpose
This set of Bazel rules and tools will provide an OpenSSL library build that can be depended upon by other Bazel targets.

## Motivation
Many projects rely on a locally linked OpenSSL library for their security needs. In addition, many a third-party project
will find its way into a Bazel build system. In order to leverage the full capabilities of the Bazel build system, third
party libraries should be built locally within a given project using Bazel itself. There do not _seem_ to be many
mostly-pure Starlark implementations out there that can be openly leveraged. This little implemenation aims to address
that.

## Plan of Attack
A tried-but-true method of porting build systems is to capture the output of a build that is known to work, and then
reverse engineer the verbose output. In the spirit of textual analysis and extraction, perl will be used to generate
appropriate, static, Starlark. Files that are generated by perl scripts will be locally stored in this repository.
